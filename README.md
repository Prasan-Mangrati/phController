# üß™ pH Regulator System Setup Guide

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Do not modify the code or wiring unless you are confident in what you're doing. Mishandling may cause damage or inaccurate pH regulation.

## üì¶ Overview

This system is designed to regulate the pH of a water solution (e.g., fish tank, hydroponic reservoir) using acid and base pumps controlled by an Arduino.

---

## üîß Hardware Setup

### 1. Acid Pump
- Connect the **INPUT** tube of the acid pump to the **acidic solution**.
- Connect the **OUTPUT** tube of the acid pump to the **water solution**.

### 2. Base Pump
- Connect the **INPUT** tube of the base pump to the **basic (alkaline) solution**.
- Connect the **OUTPUT** tube of the base pump to the **water solution**.

### 3. Arduino Power
- Use a **MicroUSB cable** with an appropriate adapter.
- Connect it to the Arduino and power it on.

### 4. Motor Power
- Use the **provided 12V adapter** to power the pumps.
- Plug the adapter directly into a wall socket.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ensure all live wires are properly insulated.**
- ‚ùå **Do not modify the wiring.**

## üßº Sensor Care & Maintenance

### 5. pH Sensor Precautions
- Keep the **BNC board** (where the pH probe connects) **completely dry**.
- Do **not adjust** the onboard **potentiometers**.

### 6. pH Probe Maintenance
- Clean the pH probe **weekly** to maintain accuracy and extend lifespan.
- Never allow the probe to **dry out** ‚Äî always store it in proper solution when not in use.

## ‚úÖ Recommended Practice

- Use a **separate manual pH meter** to cross-check readings periodically.
- This helps verify system accuracy and troubleshoot if needed.
